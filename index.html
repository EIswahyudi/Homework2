                            <p>Hello! Thank you for visiting this page. My name is Evan Iswahyudi. I am from
                                Shoreline,
                                Washington.
                                I graduated from University of Washington in 2017 majoring in GIS (Geographic
                                Information
                                System).
                                I have worked in different companies before I came into the web development.
                                My work experieces have taught me multitude skills in different areas. Looking back
                                I
                                would
                                not be
                                where I am today without having these experiences. Currently, I am attending the
                                University
                                of Washington
                                Bootcamp.
                                Initially, I was reluctant to go back to school after so many years of working. But,
                                this
                                program has been
                                nothing
                                but AWESOME. Not only that I get to gain knowledge, but the students interactions,
                                group
                                discussions,
                                projects, etc. have
                                made it more exciting! I cannot wait to learn more and be able to use it for the
                                stuff I
                                want to create. </p>
                            <p>
                                Things I like to do: Photography, Sports, Drumming, and Snowboarding. The good thing
                                about
                                my
                                hobbies is that
                                I get to be
                                active all year long. There is no season where I cannot enjoy esp. with photography.
                                People
                                often ask me
                                what
                                I like to do for fun. And when I answer photography, that usually cover my base for
                                all
                                year
                                long. There is
                                beauty in
                                every season.
