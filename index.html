                        <p>Hello! Thank you for visiting this page. My name is Evan Iswahyudi. I am from
                            Shoreline,
                            Washington.
                            I graduated from University of Washington in 2017 majoring in GIS (Geographic
                            Information
                            System).
                            I have worked in different companies before I came into the web development.
                            My work experieces have taught me multitude skills in different areas. Looking back
                            I
                            would
                            not be
                            where I am today without having these experiences. Currently, I am attending the
                            University
                            of Washington
                            Bootcamp.
                            Initially, I was reluctant to go back to school after so many years of working. But,
                            this
                            program has been
                            nothing
                            but AWESOME. Not only that I get to gain knowledge, but the students interactions,
                            group
                            discussions,
                            projects, etc. have
                            made it more exciting! I cannot wait to learn more and be able to use it for the
                            stuff I
                            want to create. </p>
                        <p>
                            Things I like to do: Photography, Sports, Drumming, and Snowboarding. The good thing
                            about
                            my
                            hobbies is that
                            I get to be
                            active all year long. There is no season where I cannot enjoy esp. with photography.
                            People
                            often ask me
                            what
                            I like to do for fun. And when I answer photography, that usually cover my base for
                            all
                            year
                            long. There is
                            beauty in
                            every season.
